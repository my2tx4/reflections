When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    
hard drive may crash and/or project may have other contributors as well


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
 automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    
I can control all commits by changes which were introduced by me.



Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

    

fork - no idea. 
clone - clone repository from server to local machine. 
branch - particular development version of application




What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote 
stored locally?

    

it has final version of code from whole team.


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier, 
and what would be harder?

    

copying code manually, can cause a lot of issues. Space size will be huge for all versions. Almost impossible to track old changes.




When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in 
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    

if feature is new and needs to be fully completed and tested berore merging to master branch.
